Dockerfile Overview
The Dockerfile is designed for Node.js applications. It:

Uses the official Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) version as a base.
Sets a working directory in the container to /usr/src/app.
Installs necessary application dependencies using npm.
Assumes the application runs on port 3000 (adjust if necessary).
Jenkinsfile Overview
The Jenkinsfile provides a pipeline with the following stages:

Checkout: Clones the repository.
Build Docker Image: Builds a Docker image of the application.
Test: Runs tests inside the Docker container.
Push to DockerHub: Pushes the Docker image to DockerHub.
Deploy: Deploys the application (only on the 'main' branch).
It also sends notifications to Slack when the build starts and completes.
